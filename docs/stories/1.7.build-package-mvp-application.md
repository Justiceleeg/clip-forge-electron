# Story 1.7: Build and Package MVP Application

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to build and package the application into a distributable native format,
**so that** the MVP can be submitted and tested as a real desktop app.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Build scripts are configured for the chosen framework (Electron/Tauri).
2. A successful build produces native installers/packages (e.g., .dmg, .exe, .AppImage).
3. The packaged application launches and runs correctly, demonstrating all MVP features (Import, Timeline Display, Preview, Trim, Export).
4. The application meets the MVP deadline (Tue Oct 28th, 10:59 PM CT).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Configure Electron Builder (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Setup electron-builder.json configuration
  - [ ] Configure build targets (macOS .dmg, Windows .exe, Linux .AppImage)
  - [ ] Set up code signing for distribution
  - [ ] Configure app metadata and icons
- [ ] Task 2: Setup Build Scripts (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create build scripts in root package.json
  - [ ] Configure development build process
  - [ ] Setup production build process
  - [ ] Add packaging scripts for different platforms
- [ ] Task 3: Bundle FFmpeg Binaries (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Ensure FFmpeg binaries are included in build
  - [ ] Configure binary permissions and paths
  - [ ] Test FFmpeg functionality in packaged app
  - [ ] Handle FFmpeg binary distribution
- [ ] Task 4: Configure Application Metadata (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Set application name, version, and description
  - [ ] Configure application icons for all platforms
  - [ ] Setup application permissions and capabilities
  - [ ] Configure application window settings
- [ ] Task 5: Test Packaged Application (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Test application launch on target platforms
  - [ ] Verify all MVP features work in packaged app
  - [ ] Test file import functionality
  - [ ] Test video preview and trim functionality
  - [ ] Test export functionality
- [ ] Task 6: Final MVP Validation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Run complete MVP feature testing
  - [ ] Verify performance targets are met
  - [ ] Test application stability and error handling
  - [ ] Prepare MVP for submission

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6: Basic single-clip export functionality is implemented with FFmpeg integration and progress feedback.

### Data Models
No new data models required - uses existing project structure and configuration.

### API Specifications
No new API specifications required - uses existing IPC communication and file system access.

### Component Specifications
No new components required - uses existing UI components and services.

### File Locations
**Build Configuration Files** [Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]:
- electron-builder.json (root level)
- package.json (root level with build scripts)
- vite.config.ts (renderer build configuration)

**Binary Files** [Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]:
- apps/electron/bin/ffmpeg
- apps/electron/bin/ffprobe

**Application Assets**:
- apps/renderer/public/icons/ (application icons)
- apps/renderer/public/images/ (application images)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Manual testing for MVP
- Test file location: apps/electron/tests/ and apps/renderer/tests/
- Test cases: Application launch, MVP features, platform compatibility
- Performance: Application launch time, feature responsiveness

### Technical Constraints
**Electron Builder Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use Electron Builder for desktop app packaging
- Configure build targets for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Handle code signing for distribution

**FFmpeg Binary Distribution** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Bundle FFmpeg binaries in packaged application
- Ensure proper binary permissions and paths
- Handle cross-platform binary compatibility

**Build Process** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use Vite for frontend build process
- Configure Electron main process build
- Handle asset bundling and optimization

**Performance Targets** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Application launch time under 5 seconds
- Responsive UI with 10+ clips loaded
- Smooth video preview playback (30 fps target)
- Stable export process without crashes

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Approach**: Manual testing for MVP
- **Test Location**: apps/electron/tests/ and apps/renderer/tests/
- **Test Framework**: Manual verification only
- **Key Test Cases**:
  - Build scripts execute successfully
  - Native installers are created (.dmg, .exe, .AppImage)
  - Packaged application launches correctly
  - All MVP features work in packaged app
  - Import functionality works
  - Timeline display works
  - Video preview works
  - Trim functionality works
  - Export functionality works
  - Application meets performance targets
  - MVP deadline is met
