# Story 1.5: Implement Basic Trim Functionality

## Status
In Progress - Multi-clip functionality pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to define start and end points for clips on the timeline and play the entire timeline sequence,
**so that** I can select portions of videos and preview the complete edited sequence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ User can interact with the clip representation on the timeline (e.g., dragging handles, entering timecodes) to set an in-point.
2. ✅ User can interact with the clip representation on the timeline to set an out-point.
3. ✅ The preview player respects the set in/out points during playback (plays only the selected portion).
4. ✅ The visual representation on the timeline updates to indicate the trimmed section.
5. ⏳ The preview player plays the entire timeline sequence (all clips end-to-end) without requiring clip selection.
6. ⏳ Timeline position determines which clip/segment is currently playing.
7. ⏳ Playback seamlessly transitions between multiple clips on the timeline.

### Data Models
**VideoClip Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface VideoClip {
  id: string;
  filePath: string;
  name: string;
  duration: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  fps: number;
  trimStart: number;  // Start trim point in seconds
  trimEnd: number;    // End trim point in seconds
  thumbnailPath: string;
}
```

**TimelineClip Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface TimelineClip {
  id: string;
  videoClipId: string;
  trackId: string;
  startTime: number;    // Timeline position in seconds
  endTime: number;      // Timeline end position in seconds
  trimStart: number;    // Trim start point in source clip
  trimEnd: number;      // Trim end point in source clip
  selected: boolean;
}

interface TimelineSequence {
  clips: TimelineClip[];
  totalDuration: number;
  currentPosition: number;
  activeClip: TimelineClip | null;
}
```
