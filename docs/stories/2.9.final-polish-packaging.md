# Story 2.9: Final Polish & Packaging

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to ensure all core features are working, performance targets are reasonably met, and the final application is packaged correctly for submission,
**so that** the complete desktop video editor can be delivered by the deadline.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All core features (recording, import, timeline editing, preview, export) are functional.
2. Performance meets targets (responsive UI, smooth preview, stable export) [NFR1-NFR6].
3. Key testing scenarios are passed.
4. Final application is built and packaged for submission by Wed Oct 29th, 10:59 PM CT.
