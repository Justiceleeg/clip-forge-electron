## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Video import functionality is implemented with VideoClip data model and project state management.

### Data Models
**Timeline Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface Timeline {
  duration: number;
  playheadPosition: number;
  zoomLevel: number;
  tracks: TimelineTrack[];
  snapToGrid: boolean;
  gridSize: number;
}
```

**TimelineTrack Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface TimelineTrack {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'video' | 'audio';
  clips: TimelineClip[];
  muted: boolean;
  volume: number;
}
```

**TimelineClip Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface TimelineClip {
  id: string;
  videoClipId: string;
  trackId: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  trimStart: number;
  trimEnd: number;
  selected: boolean;
}
```

### API Specifications
No new API specifications required - uses existing project state management.

- Ensure proper visual hierarchy

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Approach**: Manual testing for MVP
- **Test Location**: apps/renderer/tests/
- **Test Framework**: Manual verification only
- **Key Test Cases**:
  - Timeline displays after clip import
  - Clip blocks appear with correct duration-based width
  - At least one track is visible
  - Timeline updates when new clips are imported
  - Visual representation matches clip duration
  - Timeline layout is responsive
  - Playhead is visible on timeline
  - Playhead click-to-seek functionality works
  - Playhead position updates correctly
