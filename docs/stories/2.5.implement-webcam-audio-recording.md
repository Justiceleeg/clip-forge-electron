## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4: Recording infrastructure already exists. RecordingService handles screen recording with MediaRecorder. IPC handlers exist for recording operations. RecordingDialog and RecordingControls components are created. Auto-import functionality exists.

**Current State**: Recording service supports screen recording. Need to extend for webcam/microphone device selection and streams.

### Data Models
**Recording State Extension** [Source: Story 2.4]:
```typescript
interface RecordingState {
  isRecording: boolean;
  recordingStartTime: number | null;
  recordingMode: 'screen' | 'webcam' | 'screen+webcam';
  selectedSource: ScreenSource | null;
  selectedWebcam: MediaDeviceInfo | null;
  selectedMicrophone: MediaDeviceInfo | null;
  outputPath: string | null;
}
```

**Device Types**:
```typescript
interface MediaDevice {
  deviceId: string;
  label: string;
  kind: 'videoinput' | 'audioinput';
}
```

### API Specifications
**IPC Commands** [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]:
```typescript
// New IPC commands (or use renderer-side getUserMedia directly)
'get-webcam-devices': () => Promise<MediaDeviceInfo[]>;
'get-microphone-devices': () => Promise<MediaDeviceInfo[]>;
'start-webcam-recording': { 
  webcamDeviceId: string;
  microphoneDeviceId?: string;
  includeAudio?: boolean;
} => Promise<void>;

// Existing commands reused
'stop-recording': () => Promise<{ filePath: string }>;

// IPC events (same as Story 2.4)
'recording-started': { success: boolean; mode: 'screen' | 'webcam' };
'recording-stopped': { filePath: string };
'recording-error': { error: string };
```

**Renderer-Side API** (Alternative - use getUserMedia directly in renderer):
```typescript
// Direct API in renderer (preferred for getUserMedia)
navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices(): Promise<MediaDeviceInfo[]>;
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints: MediaStreamConstraints): Promise<MediaStream>;
```

**Electron Service API Extension** [Source: Story 2.4]:
```typescript
// Extend electronService with webcam methods
getWebcamDevices(): Promise<MediaDeviceInfo[]>; // If using IPC, else use directly
getMicrophoneDevices(): Promise<MediaDeviceInfo[]>; // If using IPC, else use directly
startWebcamRecording(options: {
  webcamDeviceId: string;
  microphoneDeviceId?: string;
  includeAudio?: boolean;
}): Promise<void>;
// Reuse stopRecording from Story 2.4
```

### Component Specifications
**WebcamRecordingDialog Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Modal dialog for selecting webcam and microphone
- Display list of available webcam devices
- Display list of available microphone devices
- Live preview of selected webcam feed
- Audio level indicator for microphone (optional)
- Checkbox/dropdown for microphone selection (can be "None")
- Cancel and Start Recording buttons
- Handle permission requests and errors

**RecordingDialog Enhancement** [Source: Story 2.4]:
- Extend existing RecordingDialog to include microphone selection
- Add microphone device selector to screen recording dialog
- Allow microphone selection for both screen and webcam modes
- Show microphone audio level indicator

**RecordingControls Enhancement** [Source: Story 2.4]:
- Add "Record Webcam" button/option
- Show current recording mode (Screen/Webcam)
- Reuse existing recording indicator and timer
- Handle webcam recording state

**RecordingService Extension** [Source: Story 2.4]:
- Extend existing RecordingService to support webcam mode
- Add getUserMedia() calls for webcam/microphone
- Combine video and audio streams
- Reuse existing MediaRecorder and file saving logic
- Handle device-specific errors

### File Locations
**New Files**:
- `apps/renderer/src/components/recording/WebcamRecordingDialog.tsx` - Webcam device selection (or extend RecordingDialog)
- `apps/renderer/src/hooks/useMediaDevices.ts` - Hook for device enumeration (optional, for organization)

**Modified Files**:
- `apps/electron/src/services/recordingService.ts` - Add webcam recording methods
- `apps/electron/src/handlers/ipcHandlers.ts` - Add webcam device handlers (if using IPC)
- `apps/renderer/src/components/recording/RecordingDialog.tsx` - Add webcam/mic selection or create separate dialog
- `apps/renderer/src/components/recording/RecordingControls.tsx` - Add webcam recording option
- `apps/renderer/src/services/electronService.ts` - Add webcam recording methods (if using IPC)
- `apps/renderer/src/types/electron.d.ts` - Add webcam recording types
- `apps/renderer/src/App.tsx` - Integrate webcam recording controls

**Note**: getUserMedia() can be called directly in renderer process (no IPC needed), which is simpler and more standard. IPC may only be needed if device enumeration is done in main process.

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Manual testing for MVP
- Test file location: apps/renderer/tests/ (renderer-side testing)
- Test cases: Device enumeration, webcam selection, microphone selection, recording, permissions
- Performance: Recording should not cause UI freezing, preview should be responsive

**Key Test Cases**:
- Click "Record Webcam" opens device selection dialog
- Dialog displays available webcam devices with names
- Dialog displays available microphone devices with names
- Selecting webcam shows live preview feed
- Preview updates when different webcam is selected
- Selecting microphone shows audio level indicator (optional)
- Starting recording with webcam and microphone works correctly
- Starting recording with webcam only (no microphone) works correctly
- Recording indicator appears during webcam recording
- Recording duration timer increments correctly
- Stop recording saves webcam video file correctly
- Recorded file is saved to ~/.clipforge/recordings/
- Recorded file is automatically imported after recording
- Recorded clip appears in media library
- Audio is included in recording when microphone selected
- Recording works without microphone (video only)
- Camera permission denied shows helpful error message
- Microphone permission denied shows helpful error message
- Device unavailable errors handled gracefully
- Device disconnection during recording handled gracefully
- Selecting microphone for screen recording works (Story 2.4 extension)
- Screen recording with microphone audio works
- Screen recording with system audio + microphone works
- Multiple webcam recordings create separate files
- Recording doesn't crash or freeze UI
- Cannot start multiple recordings simultaneously
- Preview feed cleanup when dialog closes
- Webcam preview shows correct feed (not reversed/mirrored issue)

### Technical Constraints
**MediaDevices API** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` for device list
- Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` for webcam/microphone access
- Requires HTTPS or localhost in browser (Electron handles this)
- Permission requests are browser-managed
- Device labels require active media stream in some browsers

**Platform Considerations** [Source: architecture.md#development-workflow]:
- **macOS**: Requires camera and microphone permissions in System Preferences
- **Windows**: May require permissions depending on Windows version
- **Linux**: Typically works without special permissions
- Device permissions are per-application
- Users must grant permissions before accessing devices

**Permission Handling** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Request permissions when user opens device selector
- Show clear permission denied messages
- Guide users to system settings if needed
- Handle permission revocation gracefully
- Test permission flows on all target platforms

**Stream Combination** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Combine video and audio streams using MediaStream constructor
- Or add audio track to video stream using addTrack()
- Ensure stream synchronization
- Handle stream disconnection
- Clean up streams on errors

**Webcam-Specific Constraints** [Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]:
- Webcam preview may show mirrored feed (common UX pattern)
- Handle multiple webcam connections/disconnections
- Optimize preview feed to not consume too much CPU
- Consider resolution/quality settings for recording vs. preview
- Handle webcam busy errors (device in use by another app)

**Audio Constraints** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Some webcams have built-in microphones
- Allow user to choose: use webcam mic or separate microphone
- Handle audio-only recording option (for voiceovers)
- Test audio sync between video and audio tracks
- Handle audio level monitoring for feedback (optional)

**File Management** [Source: Story 2.4]:
- Save webcam recordings to `~/.clipforge/recordings/` directory
- Generate unique filenames: `webcam-recording-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss.webm`
- Reuse file saving logic from Story 2.4
- Handle disk space issues gracefully

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Handle device unavailable errors
- Handle permission denied errors
- Handle device disconnection during recording
- Handle stream errors
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Clean up resources on error
- Recover gracefully from errors

**State Management** [Source: Story 2.4]:
