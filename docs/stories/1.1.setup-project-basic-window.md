# Story 1.1: Setup Project & Basic Window

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial Electron project structure with a basic application window,
**so that** I have a foundation to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project structure (Electron or Tauri) is created.
2. Dependencies for the chosen framework are installed.
3. A basic, empty main application window launches successfully.
4. Basic build/packaging script is functional, producing a runnable app.

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Manual testing for MVP (no automated tests required)
- Test file location: apps/electron/tests/ and apps/renderer/tests/
- Focus on basic functionality verification
- Test application launch and window creation

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Node.js 20+ required
- npm 10+ required
- Electron 28+ for desktop framework
- React 18.2+ for UI components
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- Vite 5+ for frontend build tool
- Electron Builder for packaging

**Development Environment** [Source: architecture.md#development-workflow]:
- Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, npm 10+
- Development commands: npm run dev, npm run build, npm run package
- Hot reload configuration for development
- Cross-platform packaging (.dmg, .exe, .AppImage)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Approach**: Manual testing for MVP
- **Test Location**: apps/electron/tests/ and apps/renderer/tests/
