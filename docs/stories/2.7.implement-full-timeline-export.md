# Story 2.7: Implement Full Timeline Export

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to export the entire sequence of clips arranged on the timeline, including cuts and overlays,
**into a single MP4 file**,
**so that** I can share my final video.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The export function processes all clips on the timeline in their arranged sequence [FR26].
2. Trims, splits, and deletions applied on the timeline are reflected in the output [FR26].
3. Video from multiple tracks is correctly composited in the output [FR19, FR26].
4. Users can select the export resolution (720p, 1080p, source) [FR27].
5. A progress indicator is shown during export [FR28].
6. The final MP4 is saved to the user's chosen location [FR29].

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6: Basic single-clip export exists. FFmpegService.exportTimeline() handles single-track export with concatenation. Export dialog and progress indicator exist. Resolution scaling exists for single clips.

From Story 2.1: Multiple clips can be arranged on timeline sequentially. Timeline tracks contain TimelineClip instances with trimStart/trimEnd.

From Story 2.2: Split clips create multiple TimelineClip instances from same VideoClip. Delete operations remove clips from timeline. Clips maintain trim points after split.

From Story 2.3: Multiple tracks exist. Track order determines layering (tracks[0] = bottom, tracks[n] = top). Clips on different tracks can overlap in time.

**Current State**: FFmpegService.exportTimeline() handles single track export only. Need to extend for multi-track composition using FFmpeg overlay filters.

### Data Models
**Export Settings** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface ExportSettings {
  resolution: '720p' | '1080p' | 'source';
  quality: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  format: 'mp4';
  fps: number;
  bitrate: number;
  audioBitrate: number;
}
```

**Timeline Export Configuration**:
```typescript
interface TimelineExportConfig {
  timeline: Timeline;
  clips: VideoClip[];
  settings: ExportSettings;
  outputPath: string;
  includeAllTracks: boolean; // Export all tracks or just first
  handleGaps: 'black' | 'previous-frame' | 'error'; // How to handle gaps
}
```

### API Specifications
**IPC Commands** [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]:
```typescript
// Existing command (may need enhancement)
'export-video': {
  timeline: Timeline;
  clips: VideoClip[];
  outputPath: string;
  settings: ExportSettings;
} => Promise<void>;

// Events (existing)
'video-processing-progress': { progress: number; message?: string };
'video-processed': { outputPath: string };
'video-processing-error': { error: string };
```

**FFmpegService Methods**:
```typescript
// Enhanced method
exportTimeline(
  timeline: Timeline,
  clips: VideoClip[],
  outputPath: string,
  settings: ExportSettings,
  onProgress?: (progress: number, message?: string) => void
): Promise<void>;

// New helper methods
private processMultiTrackComposition(...): Promise<void>;
private buildFFmpegFilterGraph(...): string;
private processTimelineSegment(...): Promise<void>;
```

### Component Specifications
**ExportDialog Component** [Source: Story 1.6]:
- Update to show timeline duration and clip count
- Add resolution selector (720p, 1080p, source)
- Show export settings summary
- Display estimated file size (optional)
- Show progress during export
- Handle export cancellation

**ProgressBar Component** [Source: Story 1.6]:
- Enhance to show detailed progress messages
- Show stage information (processing, compositing, finalizing)
- Display percentage and time remaining (optional)

### File Locations
**Modified Files**:
- `apps/electron/src/services/ffmpegService.ts` - Multi-track export implementation
- `apps/renderer/src/components/export/ExportDialog.tsx` - Resolution selection, timeline info
- `apps/renderer/src/components/export/ProgressBar.tsx` - Enhanced progress display
- `apps/electron/src/handlers/ipcHandlers.ts` - Export handler updates (if needed)
- `packages/shared/src/types/video.ts` - ExportSettings updates (if needed)

**New Files**:
- None required - extending existing functionality

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Manual testing for MVP
- Test file location: apps/electron/tests/
- Test cases: Single track export, multi-track export, trims, splits, deletions, resolutions
- Performance: Export should complete without crashes, handle large timelines

**Key Test Cases**:
- Export single clip on timeline - works correctly
- Export multiple clips on single track - sequences correctly
- Export with trimmed clips - trims applied correctly
- Export with split clips - split segments appear correctly
- Export with deleted clips - gaps handled correctly
- Export with 2 tracks (overlay) - composes correctly
- Export with overlapping clips - overlay works correctly
- Export at 720p resolution - scales correctly
- Export at 1080p resolution - scales correctly
- Export at source resolution - maintains original size
- Progress indicator shows during export
- Progress messages update correctly
- Export saves to selected location
- Export format is MP4 and playable
- Multi-track export maintains track ordering
- Overlay tracks appear on top of base track
- Gaps in timeline handled correctly (black frames or previous frame)
- Export with very long timeline (>1 hour) completes
- Export with multiple split clips works
- Export with clips on different tracks at different times works
- Missing source file shows error clearly
- Disk space error handled gracefully
- Export can be cancelled (if implemented)

### Technical Constraints
**FFmpeg Multi-Track Composition** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use FFmpeg overlay filter: `overlay=x:y` for positioning overlays
- Use complex filter graph for multiple overlays
- Process tracks in order (bottom to top)
- Handle overlapping clips at same timeline position
- Maintain aspect ratios during composition
- Optimize filter graph for performance

**FFmpeg Filter Graph Example**:
```
[0:v][1:v]overlay=W-w-10:10[v]; [v][2:v]overlay=W-w-10:100[vout]
```
- Base track: [0:v]
- Overlay track 1: [1:v] at position (W-w-10, 10) - top-right
- Overlay track 2: [2:v] at position (W-w-10, 100) - below track 1
- Output: [vout]

**Trim and Split Handling** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Use `-ss startTime -t duration` for each clip segment
- Calculate duration from trimStart and trimEnd
- Process each TimelineClip independently
- Handle multiple TimelineClips from same VideoClip (split clips)
- Ensure frame-accurate trimming

**Resolution Scaling** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Use FFmpeg scale filter: `scale=1280:720` or `scale=1920:1080`
- Apply to base track, then overlays maintain relative positioning
- Preserve aspect ratio if source is not 16:9
- Handle mixed aspect ratios in timeline

**Timeline Gaps** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Generate black frames for gaps: `-f lavfi -i color=c=black:s=WxH:d=GAP_DURATION`
- Or use previous frame: use `-shortest` and let FFmpeg handle
- Default strategy: black frames for gaps
- Optional: Show gap warning in export dialog

**Performance Optimization** [Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]:
- Use hardware acceleration if available (`-hwaccel`)
- Optimize encoding presets for multi-track
- Use efficient codec options
- Process in stages: trim clips → composite → finalize
- Clean up temporary files promptly
- Monitor memory usage for large exports

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Validate timeline before export
- Check source files exist
- Handle FFmpeg errors gracefully
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Clean up on failure
- Allow retry after error

**Export Duration** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Export duration = max endTime of all clips on all tracks
- Include gaps in duration calculation
- Ensure timeline duration matches export duration
- Handle empty timeline (show error, don't export)

**File Format** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Output format: MP4 (H.264 video, AAC audio)
- Use `-movflags +faststart` for streaming
- Optimize for web playback
- Ensure compatibility with common players

**Audio Handling** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Extract audio from base track (Track 0)
- Mix audio from multiple tracks if needed (optional)
- Sync audio with composite video
- Handle clips without audio gracefully
- Use AAC codec for audio
