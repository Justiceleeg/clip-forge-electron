# Story 1.4: Implement Video Preview Player

## Status
In Progress - Timeline Ruler & Zoom Complete

## Story

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3: Timeline components are implemented with clip visualization and track management.

### Data Models
**VideoClip Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface VideoClip {
  id: string;
  filePath: string;
  name: string;
  duration: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  fps: number;
  trimStart: number;
  trimEnd: number;
  thumbnailPath: string;
}
```
