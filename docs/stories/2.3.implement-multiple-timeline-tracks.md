## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2: Split and delete operations work on individual clips within tracks. Clips can be selected and manipulated on timeline.

From Story 2.1: Multiple clips can be imported and arranged. Drag & drop functionality exists for clips on timeline.

From Story 1.4: VideoPlayer handles single clip playback with preview synchronization. Preview uses HTML5 video element for playback.

**Current State**: Timeline already has track structure (TimelineTrack interface, addTrack/removeTrack actions), but currently defaults to single track. TimelineTrack component exists and renders clips.

### Data Models
**TimelineTrack Structure** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- Multiple TimelineTrack instances in timeline.tracks array
- Each track has: id, name, type ('video' | 'audio'), clips[], muted, volume
- Track order in array determines layering order (higher index = top layer)
- Clips on different tracks can overlap in time (same startTime/endTime)

**TimelineClip Track Assignment** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- TimelineClip.trackId references the TimelineTrack.id
- Clips can be moved between tracks by changing trackId
- Clips on same track maintain sequential ordering
- Clips on different tracks are independent in ordering

**Multi-Track Composition** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- At any playhead position, multiple clips from different tracks may be active
- Composition order: tracks[0] = bottom, tracks[n] = top
- Top track videos overlay bottom track videos
- All tracks render simultaneously if clips overlap in time

### API Specifications
**Timeline Store Actions** [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]:
```typescript
// Existing track actions (already in timelineStore)
addTrack: (track: Omit<TimelineTrack, "id">) => void;
removeTrack: (trackId: string) => void;
updateTrack: (trackId: string, updates: Partial<TimelineTrack>) => void;

// Enhanced clip actions
addClipToTrack: (trackId: string, clip: Omit<TimelineClip, "id">) => void; // Already exists
moveClipToTrack: (clipId: string, newTrackId: string) => void; // New

// New helper functions
getActiveClipsAtTime: (time: number) => TimelineClip[]; // Returns clips from all tracks
getTracksAtTime: (time: number) => TimelineTrack[]; // Returns tracks with active clips
```

**IPC Updates** [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]:
- No IPC changes required - multi-track is UI-only for preview
- Export will handle multi-track composition via FFmpeg (covered in Story 2.7)

### Component Specifications
**Timeline Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Render multiple TimelineTrack components based on timeline.tracks
- Calculate track vertical positions and heights
- Handle drop zone calculation to determine target track
- Pass correct track context to each TimelineTrack component
- Ensure ruler spans all tracks visually

**TimelineTrack Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Display track header with track name
- Render clips within track bounds
- Handle drop operations specific to this track
- Visual styling to distinguish from other tracks
- Show track type indicator (video/audio)
- Handle track-specific interactions

**VideoPlayer Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Determine active clips across all tracks at current playhead
- Load video sources for all active clips simultaneously
- Composite video layers using Canvas API
- Handle layering order (tracks[0] = bottom, tracks[n] = top)
- Maintain smooth playback during multi-layer composition
- Handle video positioning/sizing for overlay effects

**VideoCompositor Service** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Create utility class/service for video composition
- Manage multiple HTML5 video elements (one per active clip)
- Use Canvas API to composite video layers
- Handle video synchronization across layers
- Optimize performance for smooth playback
- Handle video loading and disposal

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Manual testing for MVP
- Test file location: apps/renderer/tests/
- Test cases: Multiple tracks display, drag to tracks, composition preview
- Performance: Smooth preview with 2+ tracks active, maintain 30fps

**Key Test Cases**:
- Timeline displays at least 2 video tracks by default
- Tracks are visually distinct and labeled correctly
- Drag clip from Media Library to Track 1 - clip appears on Track 1
- Drag clip from Media Library to Track 2 - clip appears on Track 2
- Drag clip from Track 1 to Track 2 - clip moves correctly
- Place clip on Track 1 at time 0
- Place clip on Track 2 at time 0 (overlap)
- Preview shows both clips composited (Track 2 overlays Track 1)
- Preview maintains smooth playback with 2 tracks active
- Clips on different tracks can overlap in time
- Moving clip between tracks updates preview immediately
- Timeline visually represents clips on correct tracks
- Track headers display track names correctly

### Technical Constraints
**Track Initialization** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Timeline must initialize with at least 2 video tracks by default
- Track IDs must be unique and stable
- Track names should be descriptive (Video Track 1, Video Track 2)
- Track order determines composition layering

**Drag & Drop to Tracks** [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]:
- Calculate drop target track from mouse Y coordinate
- Consider track header height in drop calculation
- Validate drop target (correct track type, valid position)
- Handle edge cases (drop between tracks, drop outside tracks)
- Update clip trackId when dropped on different track

**Video Composition** [Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]:
- Use Canvas API for compositing multiple video sources
- Maintain 30fps target during multi-track playback
- Optimize video element creation/disposal
- Handle video synchronization across layers
- Pre-load video sources for smooth transitions

**Canvas Composition Strategy** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- Render bottom track video to canvas base layer
- Render top track videos as overlay layers in order
- Handle video sizing and positioning for PiP effects
- Maintain aspect ratios correctly
- Handle transparency/alpha if needed for overlay effects

**State Management** [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]:
- Zustand store must maintain track array correctly
- Track order determines composition order
- Moving clips between tracks must update state immutably
- Preview must react to track changes immediately

**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]:
- Multiple video elements must load efficiently

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Cursor)

### Debug Log References
*No critical debug logs - implementation was straightforward*

### Completion Notes List
1. **Multi-Track Timeline Initialization**: Updated `timelineStore.ts` to initialize 2 video tracks by default in `createTimelineTracks()` function. Track 2 includes default overlay position (centered at 25% scale).

2. **Track Visual Distinction**: Added alternating background colors (`bg-gray-800/50` and `bg-gray-800/70`) to tracks in `TimelineTrack.tsx` for visual distinction. Track height set to 48px with proper alignment.

3. **Drag & Drop to Specific Tracks**: 
   - Updated `Timeline.tsx` `handleDrop` to calculate target track based on drop Y position
   - Implemented cross-track clip movement with `moveClipToTrack` functionality
   - Added grab offset calculation for natural drag behavior (clip position relative to mouse stays consistent)

4. **Multi-Track Store Helpers**: 
   - Added `getActiveClipsAtTime()`, `getTracksAtTime()`, and `moveClipToTrack()` helper functions to `timelineStore.ts`
   - Enhanced `reorderClip()` with snap logic: 1s clip-to-clip threshold, snap to timeline start (0s), exact ruler tick snapping, disabled tick snapping when zoomed to 0.5s intervals

5. **Interactive Picture-in-Picture Controls**:
   - Added `overlayPosition` to `TimelineTrack` interface (x, y, scale stored per-track)
   - Implemented interactive blue border box with 4 corner resize handles
   - Drag-to-reposition: Click and drag overlay box to move Track 2 position
   - Corner resize: Drag handles to scale overlay (maintains aspect ratio, constrained to Track 1 bounds)
   - Overlay controls always visible when Track 2 exists (even without active clip)

6. **Multi-Track Preview Composition**: 
   - Implemented canvas-based video compositing in `VideoPlayer.tsx`
   - Added separate video refs (`videoRef`, `videoRef2`) with unique URL hash fragments (`#track1`, `#track2`) to force independent media instances for same-source videos
   - Created `findActiveClips()` helper to find clips from all tracks at current playhead position
   - Track 1 renders as full-screen base layer (or black screen if no clip)
   - Track 2 renders as overlay using track's `overlayPosition` settings
   - Canvas rendering uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 30fps playback

7. **Black Screen for Gaps**: Track 1 shows solid black screen (`#000000`) whenever no clip is present at playhead position (gaps or empty timeline).

8. **Paused Playhead Scrubbing**: 
   - Implemented event-based rendering using video `seeked` events
   - Canvas redraws when paused and playhead moves
   - Waits for both videos to finish seeking before rendering to prevent black flashes
   - 150ms fallback timeout for edge cases

9. **Track Layer Order**: Tracks array order determines composition layering - tracks[0] = bottom base layer, tracks[1] = top overlay layer.

10. **Timeline Clip Movement Enhancements**:
    - Snap threshold increased to 1 second for clip-to-clip and timeline-start snapping
    - Added 0.5s ruler tick marks when zoomed in
    - Ruler tick snapping disabled when tick interval ≤ 0.5s (fine-grained positioning)
    - Vertical track switching uses clip center point for natural cross-track dragging

11. **Simplified Playback Logic (Option A)**:
    - **Track 1 Continuity Requirement**: Track 1 clips must be placed end-to-end for automatic playback
    - **Gap Handling**: If there's a gap in Track 1, playback automatically stops
    - **Track 2 Flexibility**: Track 2 can have gaps; its clips overlay Track 1 when present
    - **Removed Complex Logic**: Eliminated all manual gap-advancement code, clip-end lookahead in `smoothUpdate`, and confusing animation frame management
    - **Single Source of Truth**: Only Track 1 video drives playhead position during playback
    - **Cleaner Event Handling**: `handleEnded` checks for immediate next clip (0.1s tolerance), advances if found, otherwise stops
    - **Stable Animation Frames**: Simplified `handlePause` and cleanup to properly manage `requestAnimationFrame` lifecycle

12. **End-to-End Clip Transition Fix**:
    - **Problem**: When switching between end-to-end clips (different video files), canvas would freeze on first frame despite audio playing correctly
    - **Root Cause**: Canvas rendering loop stopped when video `readyState` was < 2 during source change, and didn't restart after video became ready
    - **Solution**: Added canvas rendering restart logic in `handlePlaying` event handler
    - **Implementation**: When `playing` event fires (video actually starts playing), cancel any existing canvas animation frame and start a new rendering loop
    - **Result**: Smooth visual transitions between end-to-end clips with synchronized audio and video
