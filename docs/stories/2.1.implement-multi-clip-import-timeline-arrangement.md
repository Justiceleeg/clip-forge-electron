# Story 2.1: Implement Multi-Clip Import & Timeline Arrangement

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to import multiple clips and arrange them sequentially on the timeline,
**so that** I can build a basic video sequence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multiple clips (MP4, MOV, WebM) can be imported [FR13].
2. Clips can be dragged from a source (Media Library or directly after import) onto the timeline [FR15].
3. Clips can be reordered by dragging them on the timeline track [FR16].
4. Clips play back sequentially in the preview window based on their timeline order [FR22].

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Basic video import supports MP4/MOV. ImportDialog and fileService handle single file imports. IPC handlers process file imports and generate thumbnails.

From Story 1.3: Timeline displays single clip. Timeline component renders one track with basic clip representation. TimelineClip component shows visual representation.

From Story 1.4: VideoPlayer component handles single clip playback. Preview syncs with playhead position for single clip scenarios.

### Data Models
**TimelineClip Updates** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- Multiple TimelineClip instances can exist on a single TimelineTrack
- TimelineClip.startTime and endTime define position on timeline
- Clips must maintain sequential ordering within tracks

**TimelineTrack Updates** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- TimelineTrack.clips array supports multiple TimelineClip instances
- Clips must be ordered by startTime within track
- Need validation to prevent overlapping clips on same track

**VideoClip** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- Each imported file creates a VideoClip instance
- VideoClip instances are stored in projectStore.clips array
- TimelineClip references VideoClip via videoClipId

### API Specifications
**IPC Updates** [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]:
```typescript
// Extended import-video handler
'import-video': { filePaths: string[] }; // Support array
'file-imported': { clips: VideoClip[] }; // Return array
```

**Timeline Store Actions** [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]:
```typescript
// New timelineStore actions
addClipToTrack(clip: TimelineClip, trackId: string, startTime: number): void;
reorderClip(clipId: string, newStartTime: number): void;
updateClipPosition(clipId: string, newStartTime: number): void;
```

### Component Specifications
**ImportDialog Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Add support for `multiple` attribute on file input
- Process selected files in batch
- Show import progress for multiple files
- Display success/error feedback per file

**MediaLibrary Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Display grid/list of imported clips with thumbnails
- Enable drag operation from clip thumbnail
- Show clip metadata (name, duration, resolution)
- Handle clip selection for preview

**Timeline Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Support dropping clips from Media Library
- Handle drag operations within timeline tracks
- Calculate drop position based on mouse coordinates
- Enforce clip ordering and prevent overlaps

**TimelineClip Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Make clip draggable within timeline
- Update visual position during drag
- Calculate new startTime based on drop position
- Handle drag constraints (track bounds, other clips)

**VideoPlayer Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Determine current clip based on playhead position
- Switch video source when playhead crosses clip boundaries
- Handle seamless playback across multiple clips
- Maintain audio sync during clip transitions

## Dev Agent Record
*This section will be populated by the development agent during implementation*

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Cursor)

### Debug Log References
*No debug log entries required - implementation was straightforward*

### Completion Notes List
- Story 2.1 implementation was largely complete. Verified all major functionality:
  - ✅ Multi-file import with WebM support fully implemented in ImportDialog
  - ✅ Media Library displays multiple clips with thumbnails, metadata, and drag capability
  - ✅ Timeline drag & drop functionality working - clips can be dragged from Media Library onto timeline
  - ✅ Clip reordering implemented - clips can be dragged horizontally within timeline track
  - ✅ Sequential playback working - VideoPlayer handles multiple clips with seamless transitions
  - ✅ Timeline store fully supports multiple clips with all required actions
- Added missing `removeClip` helper method to timelineStore that automatically finds the track
- Enhanced `removeClipFromTrack` to recalculate timeline duration after clip removal
- Note: `reorderClip` already handles clip position updates with smart overlap prevention and snapping, so no separate `updateClipPosition` needed
- Fixed race condition in VideoPlayer during clip transitions: now checks video readyState before calling play() to prevent AbortError when switching between clips during playback
- All acceptance criteria met: multi-clip import, drag/drop from library, reordering, sequential playback

### File List
**Modified Files:**
- `apps/renderer/src/stores/timelineStore.ts` - Added `removeClip` helper method, enhanced `removeClipFromTrack` to recalculate duration
- `apps/renderer/src/components/preview/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Fixed race condition during clip transitions by checking video readyState before calling play()
