# Story 2.1: Implement Multi-Clip Import & Timeline Arrangement

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to import multiple clips and arrange them sequentially on the timeline,
**so that** I can build a basic video sequence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multiple clips (MP4, MOV, WebM) can be imported [FR13].
2. Clips can be dragged from a source (Media Library or directly after import) onto the timeline [FR15].
3. Clips can be reordered by dragging them on the timeline track [FR16].
4. Clips play back sequentially in the preview window based on their timeline order [FR22].

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Basic video import supports MP4/MOV. ImportDialog and fileService handle single file imports. IPC handlers process file imports and generate thumbnails.

From Story 1.3: Timeline displays single clip. Timeline component renders one track with basic clip representation. TimelineClip component shows visual representation.

From Story 1.4: VideoPlayer component handles single clip playback. Preview syncs with playhead position for single clip scenarios.

### Data Models
**TimelineClip Updates** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- Multiple TimelineClip instances can exist on a single TimelineTrack
- TimelineClip.startTime and endTime define position on timeline
- Clips must maintain sequential ordering within tracks

**TimelineTrack Updates** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- TimelineTrack.clips array supports multiple TimelineClip instances
- Clips must be ordered by startTime within track
- Need validation to prevent overlapping clips on same track

**VideoClip** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- Each imported file creates a VideoClip instance
- VideoClip instances are stored in projectStore.clips array
- TimelineClip references VideoClip via videoClipId

### API Specifications
**IPC Updates** [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]:
```typescript
// Extended import-video handler
'import-video': { filePaths: string[] }; // Support array
'file-imported': { clips: VideoClip[] }; // Return array
```

**Timeline Store Actions** [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]:
```typescript
// New timelineStore actions
addClipToTrack(clip: TimelineClip, trackId: string, startTime: number): void;
reorderClip(clipId: string, newStartTime: number): void;
updateClipPosition(clipId: string, newStartTime: number): void;
```

### Component Specifications
**ImportDialog Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Add support for `multiple` attribute on file input
- Process selected files in batch
- Show import progress for multiple files
- Display success/error feedback per file

**MediaLibrary Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Display grid/list of imported clips with thumbnails
- Enable drag operation from clip thumbnail
- Show clip metadata (name, duration, resolution)
- Handle clip selection for preview

**Timeline Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Support dropping clips from Media Library
- Handle drag operations within timeline tracks
- Calculate drop position based on mouse coordinates
- Enforce clip ordering and prevent overlaps

**TimelineClip Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Make clip draggable within timeline
- Update visual position during drag
- Calculate new startTime based on drop position
- Handle drag constraints (track bounds, other clips)

**VideoPlayer Component** [Source: architecture.md#components]:
- Determine current clip based on playhead position
- Switch video source when playhead crosses clip boundaries
- Handle seamless playback across multiple clips
- Maintain audio sync during clip transitions

### File Locations
**Modified Files** [Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]:
- `apps/renderer/src/components/media/ImportDialog.tsx` - Multi-file selection
- `apps/renderer/src/components/media/MediaLibrary.tsx` - Multiple clips display, drag source
- `apps/renderer/src/components/timeline/Timeline.tsx` - Drop zones, drag handlers

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Manual testing for MVP
- Test file location: apps/electron/tests/ and apps/renderer/tests/

- Performance: Timeline responsiveness with 10+ clips

**Key Test Cases**:
- Import multiple video files (MP4, MOV, WebM) successfully
- Drag clips from Media Library onto timeline
- Reorder clips by dragging within timeline track
- Preview plays clips sequentially based on timeline order
- Clips maintain correct positions after reordering
- Timeline correctly calculates clip positions
- Preview switches clips at correct boundaries
- No crashes with 10+ clips imported
- Drag and drop works smoothly without lag

### Technical Constraints
**File Format Support** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Extend format validation to include WebM (MP4, MOV, WebM)
- Validate file extensions and MIME types
- Handle format-specific metadata extraction

**Timeline Performance** [Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]:
- Canvas-based timeline must remain responsive with 10+ clips
- Optimize clip rendering for multiple clips
- Use efficient drag calculations to prevent lag

**State Management** [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]:
- Zustand store must handle multiple clips efficiently
- Update state immutably for drag operations
- Persist clip order and positions correctly

**Preview Playback** [Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]:
- Smooth clip transitions (no stuttering)
- Maintain 30 fps target during clip switches
- Handle audio sync across clip boundaries
- Efficient clip source switching

**Drag & Drop Implementation** [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]:
- Use HTML5 drag and drop API or pointer events
- Calculate accurate timeline positions from pixel coordinates
- Handle cross-component drag operations (Media Library â†’ Timeline)
- Provide visual feedback during drag operations

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Approach**: Manual testing for MVP
- **Test Location**: apps/electron/tests/ and apps/renderer/tests/

  - Clips appear at correct timeline positions
  - Drag clips horizontally within timeline to reorder
  - Clip reordering updates timeline correctly
  - Preview plays first clip when playhead at start
  - Preview switches to second clip at first clip's end
  - Sequential playback works correctly for 3+ clips
