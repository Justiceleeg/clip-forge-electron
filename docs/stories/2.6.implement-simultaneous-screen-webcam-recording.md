# Story 2.6: Implement Simultaneous Screen + Webcam Recording

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to record my screen and webcam at the same time, with the webcam appearing as a Picture-in-Picture overlay,
**so that** I can create engaging tutorials or presentations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can select both a screen/window source and a webcam source for simultaneous recording [FR9].
2. The recording captures both sources concurrently.
3. The resulting output places the webcam feed as a configurable PiP element over the screen recording (or saves as separate tracks for editing) [FR9].
4. Audio is captured correctly during simultaneous recording [FR10].
5. Recording can be stopped, saved, and added to the project [FR11, FR12].

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4: Screen recording infrastructure exists. RecordingService handles screen capture with MediaRecorder. Screen source selection is implemented.

From Story 2.5: Webcam recording infrastructure exists. Device selection (webcam, microphone) is implemented. getUserMedia() integration exists.

From Story 2.3: Multi-track timeline exists. Separate tracks can be added to different timeline tracks. This supports "separate tracks" recording mode.

**Current State**: Both screen and webcam recording work independently. Need to combine them with real-time composition.

### Data Models
**Simultaneous Recording Configuration**:
```typescript
interface SimultaneousRecordingConfig {
  screenSource: {
    type: 'fullscreen' | 'window';
    windowId?: string;
  };
  webcamDeviceId: string;
  microphoneDeviceId?: string;
  audioConfig: {
    includeSystemAudio: boolean;
    includeMicrophone: boolean;
    mixAudio: boolean; // Mix system + mic, or choose one
  };
  pipConfig: {
    position: 'top-left' | 'top-right' | 'bottom-left' | 'bottom-right';
    size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'custom';
    customWidth?: number;
    customHeight?: number;
    customX?: number;
    customY?: number;
  };
  recordingMode: 'composited' | 'separate-tracks';
}
```

**Recording State Extension**:
```typescript
interface RecordingState {
  isRecording: boolean;
  recordingMode: 'screen' | 'webcam' | 'simultaneous';
  simultaneousConfig?: SimultaneousRecordingConfig;
  // ... other fields from Story 2.4/2.5
}
```

### API Specifications
**IPC Commands**:
```typescript
'start-simultaneous-recording': {
  screenSource: { type: 'fullscreen' | 'window'; windowId?: string };

    includeSystemAudio: boolean;
    includeMicrophone: boolean;
    mixAudio: boolean;
  };
  pipConfig: {
    position: 'top-left' | 'top-right' | 'bottom-left' | 'bottom-right';
    size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'custom';
    customWidth?: number;
    customHeight?: number;
  };
  recordingMode: 'composited' | 'separate-tracks';
} => Promise<void>;

'stop-recording': () => Promise<{ 
  filePath?: string; // Composited mode

## Dev Agent Record
*This section was populated by the development agent during implementation*

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Cursor IDE)

### Debug Log References
**Issues Encountered and Resolved:**

1. **Audio Routing Issue**: Initial implementation placed microphone audio on screen recording instead of webcam recording. Fixed by routing audio to appropriate streams (screen: video only, webcam: video + mic audio).

2. **Three Files Created**: Event handling caused duplicate imports. Fixed by centralizing import logic in the `recording-stopped` event handler and removing manual `onRecordingComplete` calls.

3. **Webcam Stays On After Recording**: MediaStream cleanup was incomplete. Fixed by storing webcam stream reference and properly stopping all tracks in both success and error cleanup paths.

4. **Duration Mismatch Between Files**: MediaRecorders stopped asynchronously causing timing differences. Fixed by implementing synchronized stop logic where both recorders must complete before processing files.

5. **Track 2 Audio Bleed After Trim**: Video player only checked track 1 for trim end points. Fixed by adding track 2 trim end checking in playback loop and pausing video2 element when no active clip exists on track 2.

All issues resolved with comprehensive testing.

### Completion Notes List
1. **Recording Service Extended**: Added `startSimultaneousRecording()` method to RecordingService with support for both composited and separate-tracks modes
2. **RecordingCompositor Created**: Implemented real-time canvas-based video composition with HTML5 Canvas, drawing screen as base layer and webcam as PiP overlay
3. **IPC Handlers Added**: Added complete IPC communication layer for simultaneous recording operations including start, stop, and save secondary recording handlers
4. **SimultaneousRecordingDialog Created**: New UI component for dual source selection with live preview, PiP configuration controls, and recording mode selection
5. **Live Preview with PiP**: Implemented real-time preview showing screen with webcam as editable PiP overlay, updating position and size in real-time during recording
6. **Dual Recording Modes**: Implemented both composited mode (single file with PiP baked in) and separate tracks mode (two files for editing flexibility)
7. **Audio Routing Optimized**: Screen recording contains video only, webcam recording contains video + microphone audio (person talking to camera)
8. **Canvas-to-MediaRecorder Pipeline**: Optimized pipeline capturing canvas at 30fps with proper codec selection (VP9/VP8)
9. **Separate Tracks Implementation**: Dual MediaRecorder instances for screen and webcam with synchronized start/stop, proper timing synchronization to prevent duration mismatches
10. **PiP Configuration UI**: Complete controls for position (4 corners), size (small/medium/large), with real-time preview updates
11. **RecordingControls Updated**: Added "Screen + Webcam" button with proper state management, stream cleanup, and error handling
12. **Performance Optimizations**: Used requestAnimationFrame for smooth composition, hardware acceleration hints, and optimized drawing operations
13. **Auto-Import for Both Modes**: Both recordings auto-import to media library with proper event handling to prevent duplicate imports
14. **Stream Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of all MediaStream tracks including webcam to ensure camera light turns off after recording stops
15. **Track 2 Trim Support**: Fixed video player to properly pause track 2 audio when trimmed clips reach their end point, preventing audio bleed
16. **Synchronized Recording Stop**: Both MediaRecorders wait for each other to complete before processing files, ensuring matching durations
