# Epic 1: MVP Core Media Pipeline

## Epic Goal
Establish the fundamental ability to import, display, preview, trim (single clip), export (single clip), and package the desktop app by the Tuesday deadline. This proves the core technical challenge of handling media within the chosen desktop framework.

## Epic Description

### Project Context
- New Electron desktop video editor application
- Technology stack: Electron + React + TypeScript + FFmpeg
- Target: Native desktop application with video editing capabilities
- Timeline: MVP delivery by Tuesday, October 28th at 10:59 PM CT

### Epic Details
- Core media pipeline implementation for video editing workflow
- Import → Preview → Trim → Export functionality
- Desktop application packaging and distribution
- Foundation for Phase 2 recording and advanced editing features

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Setup Project & Basic Window
**As a developer, I want to set up the initial Electron project structure with a basic application window, so that I have a foundation to build upon.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Project structure (Electron or Tauri) is created.
2. Dependencies for the chosen framework are installed.
3. A basic, empty main application window launches successfully.
4. Basic build/packaging script is functional, producing a runnable app.

### Story 1.2: Implement Basic Video Import
**As a user, I want to import an MP4 or MOV video file into the application, so that I can begin editing it.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Application allows importing MP4/MOV via a native file picker.
2. (Stretch for MVP) Application allows importing MP4/MOV via drag and drop onto a designated area.
3. Successfully imported video file information (e.g., path, basic metadata if easily available) is stored internally.
4. No crashes occur with valid MP4/MOV files.

### Story 1.3: Display Clip on Simple Timeline
**As a user, I want to see my imported video clip represented visually on a simple timeline, so that I have a context for editing.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. After import, a visual block representing the video clip appears on a timeline UI element.
2. The length of the block visually corresponds (approximately) to the clip's duration.
3. The timeline displays at least one track.

### Story 1.4: Implement Video Preview Player
**As a user, I want to play back the imported video clip in a preview window, so that I can see its content.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. A video player element is present in the UI.
2. Selecting or loading the clip on the timeline loads it into the preview player.
3. The preview player can play and pause the selected video clip.
4. Audio plays back synchronized with the video (if available in the clip).

### Story 1.5: Implement Basic Trim Functionality
**As a user, I want to define start and end points for a single clip on the timeline, so that I can select a portion of the video.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User can interact with the clip representation on the timeline (e.g., dragging handles, entering timecodes) to set an in-point.
2. User can interact with the clip representation on the timeline to set an out-point.
3. The preview player respects the set in/out points during playback (plays only the selected portion).
4. The visual representation on the timeline updates to indicate the trimmed section.

### Story 1.6: Implement Basic Single-Clip Export
**As a user, I want to export the currently selected (and potentially trimmed) video clip to an MP4 file, so that I have a usable output.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. An "Export" button or menu option is available.
2. Activating export prompts the user to choose a save location and filename.
3. The application uses FFmpeg (or chosen library) to process the selected clip, applying the trim (in/out points).
4. An MP4 file is successfully created at the specified location.
5. The exported MP4 file contains only the selected (trimmed) portion of the video and corresponding audio.
6. The export process provides some basic feedback (start/end, success/failure).

### Story 1.7: Build and Package MVP Application
**As a developer, I want to build and package the application into a distributable native format, so that the MVP can be submitted and tested as a real desktop app.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Build scripts are configured for the chosen framework (Electron/Tauri).
2. A successful build produces native installers/packages (e.g., .dmg, .exe, .AppImage).
3. The packaged application launches and runs correctly, demonstrating all MVP features (Import, Timeline Display, Preview, Trim, Export).
4. The application meets the MVP deadline (Tue Oct 28th, 10:59 PM CT).

## Technical Requirements

- **Framework:** Electron with React frontend
- **Video Processing:** FFmpeg integration for trimming and export
- **File Formats:** MP4, MOV support (MVP)
- **UI Components:** Timeline, Video Player, Import/Export dialogs
- **Packaging:** Native desktop app (.dmg, .exe, .AppImage)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Functional desktop application that launches successfully
- ✅ Video import via file picker (drag & drop stretch goal)
- ✅ Visual timeline representation of imported clips
- ✅ Video preview with play/pause controls
- ✅ Basic trim functionality with visual feedback
- ✅ Single-clip export to MP4 format
- ✅ Packaged application ready for distribution

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 7 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Application builds and packages successfully
- [ ] Core video editing workflow functional end-to-end
- [ ] Performance targets met (responsive UI, smooth preview)
- [ ] MVP deadline met (Tuesday, October 28th at 10:59 PM CT)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** FFmpeg integration complexity
- **Mitigation:** Bundled FFmpeg binaries, comprehensive error handling
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to basic file operations if FFmpeg fails

## Dependencies

- **Architecture Document:** Complete (docs/architecture.md)
- **PRD:** Complete (docs/prd.md)
- **Technical Stack:** Electron + React + TypeScript + FFmpeg

## Next Steps

This epic is ready for development handoff. The stories are well-defined with clear acceptance criteria, and the technical architecture is established. The development team can begin with Story 1.1 (Project Setup) and proceed sequentially through the stories.
