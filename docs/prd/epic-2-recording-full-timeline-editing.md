## Epic Description

### Project Context
- Building on Epic 1 MVP foundation
- Technology stack: Electron + React + TypeScript + FFmpeg
- Target: Complete desktop video editor with recording capabilities
- Timeline: Phase 2 delivery by Wednesday, October 29th at 10:59 PM CT

### Epic Details
- Native screen and webcam recording functionality
- Advanced timeline editing with multiple tracks
- Multi-clip composition and export
- Picture-in-Picture recording capabilities
- Enhanced timeline usability features

## Stories

### Story 2.1: Implement Multi-Clip Import & Timeline Arrangement
**As a user, I want to import multiple clips and arrange them sequentially on the timeline, so that I can build a basic video sequence.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Multiple clips (MP4, MOV, WebM) can be imported [FR13].
2. Clips can be dragged from a source (Media Library or directly after import) onto the timeline [FR15].
3. Clips can be reordered by dragging them on the timeline track [FR16].
4. Clips play back sequentially in the preview window based on their timeline order [FR22].

### Story 2.2: Implement Split and Delete Clip Functionality
**As a user, I want to split a clip at the playhead and delete clips from the timeline, so that I have more precise editing control.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Split" action is available that divides the selected clip at the current playhead position into two independent clips [FR17].
2. A "Delete" action is available that removes the selected clip(s) from the timeline [FR18].
3. The preview updates correctly reflect splits and deletions [FR22].

### Story 2.3: Implement Multiple Timeline Tracks
**As a user, I want to place clips on at least two different tracks, so that I can create overlays or Picture-in-Picture effects.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. The timeline interface displays at least two distinct video tracks [FR19].
2. Users can drag clips onto either track.
3. The preview window correctly composites video from multiple tracks (e.g., top track overlays bottom track) [FR22].

### Story 2.4: Implement Screen Recording
**As a user, I want to record my computer screen (full screen or a specific window), so that I can capture software demonstrations or presentations.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User can initiate screen recording from the application [FR7].
2. User can choose between recording the full screen or selecting a specific application window [FR7].
3. Recording includes system audio (if technically feasible and configured).
4. User can stop the recording [FR11].
5. The resulting video file is saved and added to the media library/timeline [FR12].

### Story 2.5: Implement Webcam and Audio Recording
**As a user, I want to record video from my webcam and audio from my microphone, so that I can capture direct-to-camera footage or voiceovers.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User can select an available webcam and initiate recording [FR8].
2. User can select an available microphone and capture audio during webcam or screen recording [FR10].
3. User can stop the recording [FR11].
4. The resulting video/audio files are saved and added to the media library/timeline [FR12].

### Story 2.6: Implement Simultaneous Screen + Webcam Recording
**As a user, I want to record my screen and webcam at the same time, with the webcam appearing as a Picture-in-Picture overlay, so that I can create engaging tutorials or presentations.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User can select both a screen/window source and a webcam source for simultaneous recording [FR9].
2. The recording captures both sources concurrently.
3. The resulting output places the webcam feed as a configurable PiP element over the screen recording (or saves as separate tracks for editing) [FR9].
4. Audio is captured correctly during simultaneous recording [FR10].
5. Recording can be stopped, saved, and added to the project [FR11, FR12].

### Story 2.7: Implement Full Timeline Export
**As a user, I want to export the entire sequence of clips arranged on the timeline, including cuts and overlays, into a single MP4 file, so that I can share my final video.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. The export function processes all clips on the timeline in their arranged sequence [FR26].
2. Trims, splits, and deletions applied on the timeline are reflected in the output [FR26].
3. Video from multiple tracks is correctly composited in the output [FR19, FR26].
4. Users can select the export resolution (720p, 1080p, source) [FR27].
5. A progress indicator is shown during export [FR28].
6. The final MP4 is saved to the user's chosen location [FR29].

### Story 2.8: Enhance Timeline Usability (Zoom/Snap)
**As a user, I want to zoom in/out on the timeline and have clips snap to edges, so that I can perform more precise edits efficiently.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Controls (e.g., slider, buttons, shortcuts) allow zooming the timeline view horizontally [FR20].
2. When dragging clips, their edges automatically align (snap) with the edges of adjacent clips or the playhead [FR21].

### Story 2.9: Final Polish & Packaging
**As a developer, I want to ensure all core features are working, performance targets are reasonably met, and the final application is packaged correctly for submission.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. All core features (recording, import, timeline editing, preview, export) are functional.
2. Performance meets targets (responsive UI, smooth preview, stable export) [NFR1-NFR6].
3. Key testing scenarios are passed.
4. Final application is built and packaged for submission by Wed Oct 29th, 10:59 PM CT.

## Technical Requirements

- **Recording APIs:** Electron Screen Capture API, Webcam API, MediaRecorder
- **Video Processing:** FFmpeg for composition and export
- **File Formats:** MP4, MOV, WebM support
- **UI Components:** Enhanced timeline, recording controls, export settings
- **Packaging:** Complete desktop application with all features

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Screen recording (full screen and window selection)
- ✅ Webcam recording with audio capture
- ✅ Simultaneous screen + webcam recording (PiP)
- ✅ Multi-clip timeline editing
- ✅ Split and delete functionality
- ✅ Multi-track timeline support
- ✅ Full composition export
- ✅ Timeline zoom and snap features
- ✅ Complete packaged application

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 9 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All recording features functional
- [ ] Advanced timeline editing capabilities working
- [ ] Multi-track composition and export functional
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Phase 2 deadline met (Wednesday, October 29th at 10:59 PM CT)

## Dependencies

- **Epic 1:** Must be completed first (MVP foundation)
- **Architecture Document:** Complete (docs/architecture.md)
- **PRD:** Complete (docs/prd.md)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Recording API complexity and performance
- **Mitigation:** Native Electron APIs, proper error handling, fallback options
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable recording features if APIs fail

## Next Steps

This epic depends on Epic 1 completion. Once Epic 1 is finished, development can begin with Story 2.1 (Multi-Clip Import) and proceed through the recording and advanced editing features.
