**Session Date:** 2025-10-27
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** User

## Executive Summary

ClipForge is a project to build a production-grade native desktop video editor within a tight 72-hour timeframe, ending October 29th, 2025. Inspired by the accessibility and intuitive nature of CapCut, it will focus on essential video editing features: screen/webcam recording, clip import, timeline-based arrangement (trimming, splicing), and exporting professional-looking MP4 videos, all within a single desktop application. The primary goal is to ship a functional MVP by Tuesday, October 28th, proving the core media handling capabilities, with the final submission due Wednesday before a relocation on Thursday.

## Problem Statement

While video is the dominant content format, many desktop video editing tools require complex software and significant learning time. CapCut demonstrated that a streamlined, essential-focused interface can make video editing accessible in minutes. However, there's a need for this intuitive experience in a *native desktop application* where creators, educators, and professionals can record, edit, and export without switching apps or dealing with overly complex interfaces.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a native desktop video editor built using Electron or Tauri. It will provide a streamlined experience centered around a core workflow:
1.  **Record**: Capture screen (full or window), webcam, and microphone audio, including simultaneous screen + webcam (picture-in-picture).
2.  **Import**: Add video clips (MP4, MOV, WebM) via drag & drop or file picker.
3.  **Arrange**: Visually organize clips on a timeline, allowing trimming, splitting, deletion, sequencing, and arranging on multiple tracks (at least 2).
4.  **Export**: Render the timeline composition into a professional-looking MP4 file with resolution options.
The interface will be focused on these essentials, mimicking the intuitive nature of CapCut.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Creators, Educators, Professionals
-   **Profile**: Individuals who need to create video content regularly but may lack the time or expertise for complex professional software.
-   **Needs**: An accessible, intuitive tool for recording screen/webcam, basic editing (trimming, sequencing), and exporting videos efficiently on their desktop.
-   **Goals**: To produce professional-looking videos quickly without a steep learning curve.

## Goals & Success Metrics

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
-   **Launching App**: Packaged desktop application (Electron or Tauri) that launches successfully.
-   **Basic Import**: Import MP4/MOV files via drag & drop or file picker.
-   **Simple Timeline**: Visual timeline showing imported clips.
-   **Video Preview**: Player that plays imported clips.
-   **Basic Trim**: Ability to set in/out points on a single clip.
-   **Basic Export**: Export a single (potentially trimmed) clip to MP4 format.

### Out of Scope for MVP
-   Recording features (screen, webcam, audio).
-   Advanced timeline editing (splitting, multiple tracks, arranging sequence, zoom, snapping).
-   Media library panel, thumbnails, metadata display.
-   Advanced export options (multiple clips, resolutions).
-   Effects, transitions, text overlays, audio controls.

### MVP Success Criteria
-   Successfully build, package, and run the native desktop application.
-   Demonstrate the core media pipeline: import a video file, display it on a timeline, preview it, apply a basic trim, and export the result to MP4.
-   Meet the MVP deadline (Tuesday, Oct 28th, 10:59 PM CT).

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
-   Implement full recording capabilities: screen (full/window), webcam, microphone audio, simultaneous screen+webcam (PiP).
-   Enhance import: Support WebM, add media library panel with thumbnails and basic metadata.
-   Build full timeline editor: Drag/arrange clips, split at playhead, delete clips, multiple tracks (at least 2), zoom, snapping.
-   Improve preview: Real-time composition preview, play/pause, scrubbing, synchronized audio.
-   Expand export: Stitch multiple clips, apply cuts, offer resolution options (720p, 1080p, source), show progress indicator.

### Long-term Vision
-   Develop features from stretch goals: text overlays, transitions, audio controls, filters/effects, export presets, keyboard shortcuts, auto-save, undo/redo.
-   Potentially add cloud integration (upload, sharing links).
-   Become a go-to simple, fast desktop editor for common video creation tasks.

### Expansion Opportunities
-   Integrate with stock media libraries.
-   Add support for more input/output formats.
-   Develop collaborative editing features.
-   Offer platform-specific optimizations or features.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
-   **Target Platforms**: Native Desktop (Mac/Windows testing preferred).
-   **Performance Requirements**: Responsive UI (>10 clips), smooth preview (>30 fps), stable export, fast launch (<5s), no memory leaks.

### Technology Preferences
-   **Desktop Framework**: Electron or Tauri.
-   **Frontend**: React, Vue, Svelte, or Vanilla JS suggested.
-   **Media Processing**: FFmpeg (via fluent-ffmpeg, @ffmpeg/ffmpeg, or native Tauri commands) is essential.
-   **Timeline UI**: Canvas-based (e.g., Fabric.js, Konva.js) or custom DOM solution suggested.
-   **Video Player**: HTML5 `<video>`, Video.js, or Plyr suggested.
-   **Guiding Principle**: Use the stack that enables fastest shipping.

### Architecture Considerations
-   **Core Components**: Desktop framework, Media processing library, Timeline UI component, Video player component, File system access module.
-   **Recording APIs**: `desktopCapturer`/`getUserMedia` (Electron), Rust commands/Web APIs (Tauri), or potentially `getDisplayMedia`.
-   **Encoding**: FFmpeg required for stitching, applying cuts, and rendering final MP4.
-   **Build Strategy**: Prioritize Import/Preview -> Timeline -> Recording -> Test Export Early -> Package/Test Regularly.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
-   **Deadline**: Extremely tight 72-hour development window (Mon Oct 27 morning - Wed Oct 29 10:59 PM CT).
-   **MVP Deadline**: Hard gate on Tuesday, Oct 28th, 10:59 PM CT.
-   **Resource**: Implied single developer (based on "you'll understand", "you relocate").
-   **Focus**: Must prioritize the core loop (Record -> Import -> Arrange -> Export) and MVP features first. Pragmatism over feature richness.

### Key Assumptions
-   Developer possesses necessary skills in chosen desktop framework, frontend technology, and basic video concepts.
-   Development environment is ready.
-   FFmpeg integration is feasible within the timeframe.
-   Access to test hardware (Mac/Windows) is available if needed.
-   The definition of "professional-looking" output aligns with basic clean export, not advanced grading/effects.
-   CapCut's core workflow is a suitable and understood model.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
-   **Timeline Risk**: Failure to meet the MVP or final deadline due to the compressed schedule.
-   **Technical Complexity**: Underestimating the difficulty of video processing, real-time preview, or desktop integration.
-   **FFmpeg Integration**: Issues integrating or using FFmpeg for reliable encoding/decoding.
-   **Performance Issues**: Timeline becoming unresponsive, preview stuttering, or exports failing/being slow.
-   **Packaging/Build Issues**: Inability to create a distributable native application.
-   **Scope Creep**: Adding features beyond the core loop/MVP before fundamentals are solid.

### Open Questions
-   **Resolutions/Frame Rates**: Target export resolutions primarily 720p, 1080p, and source. Target frame rates primarily 30fps (preview min 30fps), with 60fps as a secondary option.
-   **OS Support**: What specific OS versions must be supported? (Assumption: recent versions of macOS/Windows)
-   **Advanced Features**: Effects and transitions are confirmed stretch goals.
-   **Sharing Features**: Bonus cloud upload/sharing features are confirmed non-critical.
